                        We aim to give every woman the freedom to dress the way she wants to be addressed. For too long,
                        custom clothing has been reserved for men. With Avia Samara you create custom pieces that you'll
                        actually want to wear, the way you want to wear them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We empower women to live life the way they want to. We create a space for women who may have felt
                        forgotten and a place where all women are celebrated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are here to celebrate women who challenge the status quo. We aren't just a brand—we are a
                        movement, a family committed to giving women what they want, how they want it.

                        Meet our founder, Farida Raafat. An Egyptian living in New York City, she has been in the fashion
                        industry her whole life. From learning how to sew at her family's factories, to studying at Parsons
                        in NYC, to working at brands such as TOM FORD and Rag&Bone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Farida spent most of her career building brands and making clothes for men. She was never able to
                        shake the frustration she felt when she saw how easy it was for men to customize and shop for their
                        work clothes. A professional woman herself, she decided it was time to take her expertise and
                        finally give women the clothes they want, the way they want them.
